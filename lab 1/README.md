Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple); if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".

The program takes the name(string), gender(character), company name(string), state(string) as user inputs from the employee and displaying the details.
If the input for gemder is F we print FEMALE using if else loop.
Now if the emplyee works in any of the mentioned MNCs we ahve to print the given line. This we achieve using switch case.
Also for the state the employee enters, we have to dsiplay if the meploee is from South/West/East/North/Central Indian states. To achieve this also we use a switch case.
